## Game development

- [Handmade Hero](https://hero.handmade.network/episodes) is broken up into four parts: a basic programming introduction, the construction of a platform prototyping layer, the coding of a game engine, and the coding of the game itself. These parts can be fluid, and blur into one another, but if you would like to skip directly to one of the parts without watching the preceding ones, you may be able to do so, depending on your level of experience.

    - The basic (very limited) introduction to C programming is Week 0.

    - The construction of a Win32 prototyping layer is Weeks 1 through 5.

    - Game engine coding begins on Week 6.

    - Gameplay coding begins on Week 56.
