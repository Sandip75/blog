      <description>Javascript works fine with strings and on their various operations but what about binary data consisting of bytes in which each byte is collection of 8bits that too in form of 0/1 &amp;hellip;It can&amp;rsquo;t help much so node&amp;rsquo;s buffer are here to your rescue. As all data in our computer is present in form of bytes , low-level operations like reading a file or working with sockets can&amp;rsquo;t be done alone with JS so.</description>

      <description>One question that confuses most of the people at the time they begin their developer career is &amp;ldquo;what the heck is an API?&amp;rdquo;. This article is short explaination to &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s an API and why we need it&amp;rdquo;.
Well , API stands for application programming interface , here the words that are given preference are application and interface , yes it&amp;rsquo;s just a piece of code that works between two application to help them interact with each other.</description>

      <description>Few days ago , while working on a project which required around 200 names to be displayed at once and that too on a mobile screen &amp;hellip;that&amp;rsquo;s berzerk!!!
So thought of letting the user enter the names rather than searching from giant list of hundreds so made a sweet input box and then thought of applying the filter like we do in Angular 1 using its pre-defined search filter&amp;hellip;but wait I was working on Angular 2 and surprise surprise it doesnt has a pre-defined search filter like Angular 1 did .</description>
