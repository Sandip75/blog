      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Javascript works fine with strings and on their various operations but what about binary data consisting of bytes in which each byte is collection of 8bits that too in form of 0/1 &amp;hellip;It can&amp;rsquo;t help much so node&amp;rsquo;s buffer are here to your rescue.
As all data in our computer is present in form of bytes , low-level operations like reading a file or working with sockets can&amp;rsquo;t be done alone with JS so.. Buffers are defined as container for raw bytes and it looks something like this..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Buffer 02 04 06 08 0a 0c 0e 10&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks weird so lets dive in what above stuff actually is :-
  - Buffer :- a buffer has an Object type of Buffer.
  - Size:- Above is a size 8 buffer as it has 8 pairs of weird stuff and each        pair is a byte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey , did i said wrong that byte are collection of 8bits then why above byte has 2 bits rather than 8 so lets see what it is actually ..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No - 2  Binary - 0001100  Hexadecimal - 0C
So Smart Node Devs thought that why not save some space and adopt hexa form which takes less bits than Binary thats why above Buffer object had 2 bits instead of 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;encoding-in-buffer&#34;&gt;Encoding In Buffer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34;&gt;const buf = Buffer.from([0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f, 0x20, 0x77, 0x6f, 0x72,
 0x6c, 0x64]);
 /*converts the array into a Buffer object .So it reads hey create a buffer from this array and return to buf constant.*/

console.log(buf);
// outputs &amp;lt;Buffer 68 65 6c 6c 6f 20 77 6f 72 6c 64&amp;gt;

console.log(buf.toString(&#39;utf8&#39;));
// outputs &#39;hello world&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various Commonly Used Encoding Types:-
  - UTF-8 - Includes ASCII&amp;rsquo;s (0-127) characters along with its own set and all start with 1 to avoid clashing with ASCII.
  - UTF-16 -Capable of encoding all Unicode character and encoding is of variable lenght rest google it fella :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So selecting the type of encoding can be like north and south when specially working with buffers along with other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Above Example :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34;&gt;console.log(buff.toString(&#39;utf16le&#39;));
//outputs &#39;敨汬⁯潷汲&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encoding is a Bi-directional process thus converting a string to buffer and vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceptually buffers are quite similar to arrays. They use bracket indexing and assignment just like arrays, and they have a length property as well as a concat and a slice method that works in basically the same way as arrays. However unlike javascript arrays, javascript buffers have a fixed length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Explore more kindly refer to the awesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html&#34;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; docs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is an API?</title>
      <link>https://hackions.github.io/blog/post/What-is-an-API/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2017 23:48:56 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://hackions.github.io/blog/post/What-is-an-API/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One question that confuses most of the people at the time they begin their developer career
is &amp;ldquo;what the heck is an API?&amp;rdquo;. This article is short explaination to &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s an API and why we need it&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../images/api1.png&#34; alt=&#34;api&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well , API stands for application programming interface , here the words that are given preference are
application and interface , yes it&amp;rsquo;s just a piece of code that works between two application to help them
interact with each other. For example : Imagine you are in a restaurant , consider API to be the waiter/waitress , who takes your order to the chef and then brings the food that chef prepared for you. The waiter acts as an interface between you and the chef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets take another example , lets say you have a website that you coded on your own and you want google
maps to be embedded in your site , what will you do to get google maps service on your site? Show
your source code to google and wait for them to permit you to embed google maps in your site? Absolutely
no.You will interact with google maps API which will take your request and in response will provide you
with the maps.googlemaps API which acts as an interface between your source code and google maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../images/api2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;api&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets discuss usefullness and other aspects of APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First word that pop-up when API&amp;rsquo;s are involved is &amp;ldquo;protocols&amp;rdquo;. If I make a website and create an API for my site then I will have control of the data present on my site that I am sharing with other application that are trying to access the site. APIs are the guidelines between exchange of data from one program to another.I decide what to share and what not to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This point also explains why API have a great hand in preventing ruthless web scraping.
Apart from API builder point of view API are the unsung heroes behind the worlds connectivity.
All sites in today&amp;rsquo;s world interact with each other with API and give you the desired content , like
trivago , an online hotel price comparison site makes a request of price of a hotel that you searched
to the APIs of all the travelling site , APIs of these travelling sites in response provide the prices of
that hotel to trivago and trivago simply assembles the responses from each of those sites and present it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../images/api3.png&#34; alt=&#34;api&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;API saves time , well how , lets see.
Firstly , when you visit a website the page is in HTML , two web application does not communicate with each other using HTML views , its for humans , well they talk in a language that&amp;rsquo;s more convenient and faster to understand for them.
These maybe plain text , json format , xml etc. Most applications communicate with each other in json and XML which ultimately result in faster processing of data between two apps.
Secondly , it&amp;rsquo;s always cool to login different sites with your facebook/Google login details ,  well its all APIs running behind them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that&amp;rsquo;s all , hope this help lots of developers to finally get into their mind &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s an API ? &amp;rdquo; , thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Angular 2 pipe and An npm module</title>
      <link>https://hackions.github.io/blog/post/Angular-2-pipe-and-An-npm-module/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Dec 2016 01:55:50 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://hackions.github.io/blog/post/Angular-2-pipe-and-An-npm-module/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Few days ago , while working on a project which required around 200 names to be displayed at once and that too on a mobile screen &amp;hellip;that&amp;rsquo;s berzerk!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thought of letting the user enter the names rather than searching from giant list of hundreds so made a sweet input box and then thought of applying the filter like we do in Angular 1 using its pre-defined search filter&amp;hellip;but wait I was working on Angular 2 and surprise surprise it doesnt has a pre-defined search filter like Angular 1 did ..bummed!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thought lets make one then , i looked over the Angular 2 official docs and saw pipes(&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way a pipe is nothing just this | , Yes this is a pipe .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So i dug little deeper and found PipeTransform implementing which i thought of making a filer for myself and offcourse for my project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So ng2-search filter was born which allowed to filter large list of names based on the character that user writes i.e.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you write letter &amp;lsquo;q&amp;rsquo; , then it will filter all the names having &amp;lsquo;q&amp;rsquo; in them so it totally solved my purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demo Below,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/dI5Mzvq.gif&#34; alt=&#34;demo-image&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then thought why not make it an open-source npm module , so i uploaded it on the ever-increasing npm global module repository consisting of lakhs of packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mine is called &amp;ldquo;ng2-search-filter&amp;rdquo;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-search-filter&#34;&gt;https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-search-filter&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way , the module got 117 downloads in its first 14 hrs online .&lt;/p&gt;
